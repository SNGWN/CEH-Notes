# Basic
Malware = **Mal**icious Soft**ware** - Malwares are Malicious software designed to harm systems or get sensitive information.
Malware defines a wide variety of potentially harmful software.

# Malware propagation ways
	- Free software (crack files, ...)
	- File sharing services: during the transfer, the file can be infected (torrent, ...)
	- Removable media (firmware embedded malware, ...)
	- Email (attachment, ...)
	- Not using firewall or anti-virus  -->
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Trojan --->
	Misleads from its true intention and wait for the best time to attack. Typically spread by social engineering.
	Most common use:
	- Create back door
	- Gaining unauthorized access
	- Steal information
	- Infect connected devices
	- Ransomware attacks
	- Using victim as botnet
	- Download other malicious software
	- Disable security

# Types of Trojans
	# Command Shell Trojans -->
		- Command Shell Trojans provide a remote control of command shell.
	# Botnet Trojans
		- Botnet is a large scale of compromised system, they spread over the world
		- Botnets controlled by Command and Control Centre
		- Used to launch distributed attacks, like DDoS, spamming
	# Proxy Server Trojans
		- Proxy Server Trojans turns the compromised system into a proxy server
		- Attacker use this to hide the actual source of the attack
	# Remote Access Trojans (RAT)
		- RAT allows the attacker to get remote desktop access to the victim's computer
		- RAT includes a back door to maintain the access and control over the victim
		- Attacker can monitor user, access information, alter files, etc...

# Trojan Countermeasures
	- Avoid to click on suspected email attachments
	- Monitor network traffic
	- Avoid download from entrusted sources
	- Install and update security software and anti-viruses
	- Scan removable media before use
	- File integrity
	- Configure host-based firewall
	- Intrusion detection software - IDS-IPS

# Detection Techniques for Trojans
	- Scan for suspicious network activities
	- Scan for suspicious ports
	- Scan for suspicious files and folders
	- Scan for suspicious processes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Virus and Worms
	# Viruses -->
		The virus is a self-replicating program, it is capable of producing multiple copies by attaching with another program.
		Characteristics of viruses:
		- Infecting other files
		- Alteration of data
		- Corruption
		- Encryption
		- Self-replication

	# Stages of Virus/worms Life
		- Design: develop virus from scratch or using construction kits
		- Replication: after the virus is deployed, it will replicate itself
		- Launch: user accidentally launch the infected program
		- Detection: the behaviour of a virus is observed, the virus is identified
		- Incorporation: developers design a defensive code
		- Elimination: update the anti-virus, virus eliminated
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ransomware Attack
	Ransomware is a malware program which restricts the access to the system files and folders by encrypting them. Some type of ransomware may lock the system as well. Attacker demands ransom to provide the decryption key. Ransomware is deployed using Trojans. Example: **WannaCry**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Worms
	Worms can replicate themselves but cannot attach themselves. It has the capability to travel without human action. The worm can propagate using file transport and spread across the infected network which virus is not capable of.

	# Analysis and Detection Methods
		- Scanning: the suspected file is scanned for the signature string
		- Check: the entire disk is checked for integrity, integrity checker records integrity of all files by calculating checksum usually
