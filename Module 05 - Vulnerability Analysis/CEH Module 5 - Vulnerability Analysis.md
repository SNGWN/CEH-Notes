# Vulnerability Assessment/Research
	Vulnerability Assessment is a process of examination, discovery, and identification of a system and applications security measures and weakness. It helps to recognize the vulnerabilities that could be exploited, need of additional security layers, and information that can be revealed using scanners.  
--------------------------------
# Vulnerability Assessment Life-Cycle
	- Discover: Discover Vulnerability
	- Priotize : Priotize Vulnerability as per its target, impact, loss value, Bussiness Impact, etc.
	- Report : Prepare a report on Vulnerability.
	- Remediate : Take appropriate perventive actions.
	- Verify : Verfiy that vulnerability is resolved or not.
	- Monitor : Monitor the network traffic and system behaviors for any further intrusion.

# Vulnerability Scoring System - CVSS (Critical Vulnerability Scoring System) -> CVE-CWE
	- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v2.0)
		- Low: 0.0 - 3.9
		- Medium: 4.0 - 6.9
		- High: 7.0 - 10.0

	- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3.0)
		- None: 0.0 - INFO   
		- Low: 0.1 - 3.9
		- Medium: 4.0 - 6.9
		- High: 7.0 - 8.9
		- Critical: 9.0 - 10.0

# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) - Whenever a Vulnerability is exposed globally it is distinguished by it CVE number.
	- Platforms to find information about vulnerabilities

# Vulnerability Scanners
	Vulnerability Scanners are automated utilities to detect vulnerabilities. They are capable of :-
		- OS Detection and Version Detection
		- Applications Installed
		- Accounts with Weak Passwords
		- Missing Patches
		- Weak/Misconfigured Network and Risky Ports
	These scanning tools perform deep inspection of scripts, open ports, banners, running services, configuration errors, etc...

# Top scanners:
	- Nmap Scripts - Vuln, discovery, safe, etc
	- Nikto
	- wpscan
	- Acunetix
	- Nessus
	- Qualys Free Scan
	- Crashtest - https://crashtest.cloud/login
