# Basic
	**Social engineering is an act of stealing information from humans. Its a mind manipulation technique.**
	- No interaction with target system or network
	- Non-technical attack
	- Convincing the target to reveal information
	- One of the major vulnerability which leads to this type of attack is **Trust**.
	- User trust in another user and does not secure their credentials from them.
	- Employees are uneducated at organizations, so this is a major vulnerability.
	- Lack of security policies and privacy are also vulnerable.

# Phases in Social Engineering
	**Research**
		- Collection of information from the target organization
		- Collected by dumpster diving, scanning, search on the internet, ...
	**Select target**
		- Select the target among other employees
		- A frustrated target is more preferred
	**Relationship**
		- Create relationship with the target
		- Earn the trust
	**Exploit**
		- Collecting sensitive information such as usernames, password, etc...

# Types of Social Engineering - SE Attacks
	**Human-based Social Engineering - SE**
			One-to-one interaction with the target. Earn the trust to gather sensitive information from the target.
		***Impersonation***
			- Pretend to be something or someone, pretending to be a legitimate user or authorized person.
			- Impersonation is performed by identity theft.
		***Eavesdropping and Shoulder Surfing***
			- Eavesdropping is a technique in which attacker is revealed information by listening to the conversation.
			- Reading or accessing any source of information without being notified.
			- Shoulder Surfing is a method of gathering information by standing behind the target.
		***Dumpster Diving*** --->
			- Looking for treasure in trash.
		***Piggybacking and Tailgating***
			- Piggyback is a technique in which attacker waits for an authorized person to gain entry in a restricted area.
			- Tailgating is a technique in which attacker gains access to the restricted area by following the authorized person.

	**Computer-based Social Engineering**
		***Phishing***
			Attacker send fake emails which looks like legitimate email, they're sent to hundreds, sometimes thousands, of recipients. When recipient opens the link, he is enticed for providing information. Attacker use IDN Homographic Attack (International Domain Name), In this attacker use Crylic script to register domain name and create fake website similar to actual website.
		***Spear Phishing*** --->
			Similar as phishing but it is focused on one target. Because of this, it is generate higher response rate.

	**Mobile-based Social Engineering**
		***Publishing Malicious Apps***
			These applications are normally a replica or similar copy of a popular application.
		***Repackaging Legitimate Apps***
			Repack a legitimate app with a malware.

	**Insider Attack**  --->
		Social Engineering is not all about a third person gathering information, it may be an insider with privileges.

	**Impersonation on Social Network Sites**
		***Social Engineering Through Impersonation on Social Network Sites***
			Attacker gathers personal information of a target from different sources mostly from social network sites such as full name, date of birth, email address, residential address, etc.
			After gathering the information, the attacker create an account that is exactly the same. Then introduced to friends, group joined by the target to get updates or convince the target's friends to reveal information.
		***Risks of Social Network in a Corporate Networks***
			Social network sites is not secured enough as a corporate network secures the authentication.
			The major risk of social network is its vulnerability in the authentication.
			The employee while communicating on social network may not take care of sensitive information.

	**Identity Theft**
		- Stealing the identification information of someone
		- Popularly used for frauds
		- Prove the fake identity to take advantage of it

# Countermeasures
	**Secure sensitive data**
		Store Data at rest in a secure manner (Use Encryption or Salted Hashing). Don't share Sensitive info/Documents with everyone.
	**Physical security**
	 	Who has access to Physical records (Data), who has access to sensitive areas (Server room, Admin block, Data Centres), and how you ensure that Physical security.
	**Least privileges**
		Assign least Privileges to Employees/User.
	**Strong policies**
		Password Policies, Access Policies, Device Controls, etc.
	**Training**
		Train your Employees for popular and new S.E Attacks.
	**Bio-metric authentication**
		Use Biometric authentication for Access and Entry Records.
	**Audit**
		Regular Internal Audits and External Audits
