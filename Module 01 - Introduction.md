## Information Security Fundamentals

### The CIA Triad and Non-Repudiation

The **CIA Triad** forms the foundation of information security, representing three core principles that must be maintained to ensure data security.

#### üîí Confidentiality
Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals and remains protected from unauthorized access.

**Key Implementation Methods:**
- **Authentication mechanisms**: Username/password combinations, multi-factor authentication
- **Access controls**: Role-based permissions, least privilege principle
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Physical security**: Secure storage facilities, locked workstations

**Common Attacks:**
- Data breaches and unauthorized access
- Card skimming and identity theft
- Keylogging and credential harvesting
- Phishing and social engineering
- Dumpster diving for sensitive documents

#### üõ°Ô∏è Integrity
Ensures that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered by unauthorized parties during storage and transmission.

**Key Implementation Methods:**
- **Cryptographic hashing**: SHA-256, MD5 checksums for data verification
- **Digital signatures**: Non-repudiation and authenticity verification
- **Message Authentication Codes (MAC)**: Ensuring message integrity
- **Version control**: Tracking changes and maintaining data consistency

**Common Attacks:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
- Packet interception and modification
- Data tampering and unauthorized modifications
- Database injection attacks

#### ‚ö° Availability
Ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed, maintaining business continuity.

**Key Implementation Methods:**
- **Redundancy**: Backup systems and failover mechanisms
- **Load balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers
- **Disaster recovery**: Business continuity planning
- **Regular maintenance**: System updates and performance monitoring

**Common Attacks:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- System outages and infrastructure failures
- Resource exhaustion attacks

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Non-Repudiation
Ensures that parties cannot deny their actions or transactions, providing proof of authenticity and accountability.

**Key Implementation Methods:**
- **Digital signatures**: Cryptographic proof of document authenticity
- **Audit logs**: Comprehensive tracking of user activities
- **Timestamps**: Chronological proof of events
- **Legal frameworks**: Binding agreements and documentation

**Example:** In financial transactions, non-repudiation ensures that neither the sender nor recipient can deny that a transaction occurred, supported by bank statements, transaction logs, and digital receipts.
